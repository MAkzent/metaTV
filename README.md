## Introduction

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

Do you struggle to keep up with the Meta? No idea what a funnel strat is? We have you covered! MetaTV is an esports VOD platform with high-elo commentary to help you understand what's going on. 
This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis using Nuxt (SSR Vue), Node, Knex, and Postgres.
[You can check out the demo here!](https://morning-oasis-55449.herokuapp.com//)

## Features

Current and future feature set:

* Watch VOD from YouTube
* Commentary appears over time, based on the video's timestamp. (no spoilers!)
* High elo players can add a new commentary.
* Vuetiful!

Coming soonâ„¢: 

* Login and permission (noone wants to read bronze commentary)
* More videos!
* Up / downvotes on comments
* Being able to draw on the video (I know, that would be so cool!)
